# Do I need the Teams Data Type if my MVP only needs to handle one user at a time?

If you ever plan to let your users invite other users to work together under the same umbrella then you will want to keep the Teams data type and functionality during sign up. For your single user MVP we recommend hiding the UI for teams in the settings, onboarding, and invite sections.

The easiest way to disable / hide it will be to remove from the option set account tabs. Remove the “Team Members” Option set.
