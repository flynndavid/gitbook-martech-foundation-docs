# Code Explanation: Reusable Pop-up Component

This code snippet demonstrates the implementation of a reusable pop-up component in an app for creating and editing various types of data. The pop-up component is designed to be versatile and easily adaptable for different sections of the application.

**Overview**

The app includes various types of information that require pop-ups for creating, editing, or adjusting data. The key feature of this template is the use of reusable elements within reusable elements, enhancing the modularity and reusability of the code.

**Components**

1. **Kanban Board**: The Kanban board (RE project Kanban) serves as a reusable component.
2. **Menu Icon**: The menu project icon (Menu Project Icon) is another reusable element nested within the Kanban board.

**Functionality**

* The menu icon component allows users to interact with the data by clicking on it, triggering specific actions based on the data type (e.g., lead, user, assistant, project).
* Various functions can be called within the component, such as displaying data in a pop-up.
* Workflows within the reusable components can be easily referenced and triggered from different sections of the application.

**Workflow Example**

1. When a user clicks on the menu icon within the Kanban board, data is sent to the component.
2. The component triggers the "create edit project" workflow, displaying the relevant data in a pop-up.
3. This workflow structure is a common practice in development, particularly within the Bubble platform, for creating dynamic and interactive pop-ups.

**Conclusion**

The implementation of reusable pop-up components offers a scalable and efficient way to manage data interactions within the application. Developers are encouraged to follow this pattern when adding new features or functionalities to ensure consistency and maintainability.
