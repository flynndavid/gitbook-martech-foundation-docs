# Open Admin Portal to Finish Setup

* Go to the data tab in your app, then the app data section, then search for the users table.
* From here select the admin@template.com email and click "run as" to access the admin page.
* We recommend disabling debug mode so elements display correctly. Just remove this section from the url and any “&” before it.
* The admin portal is where you can customize app-wide settings, add new sections to the dashboard, or incorporate additional features.
* To create a new admin account, you will need to go through the existing Sign Up flow and add the App Admin role (Option set) to your new user from the Bubble database. You can also manage User's roles from the Users tab in the admin portal.
