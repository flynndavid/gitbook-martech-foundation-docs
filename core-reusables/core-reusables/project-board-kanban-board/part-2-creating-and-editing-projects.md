## Exploring Project KanBan Page Capabilities <a href="#documentation-exploring-project-kanban-page-capabilities" id="documentation-exploring-project-kanban-page-capabilities"></a>

This documentation explains the new project capabilities on the project KanBan page. The key components to note are the reusable elements used to create or edit data, which consist of the main feature segment reusable element (in this case, the project KanBan board) and a pop-up reusable element (menu project) for creating or editing projects.

**Reusable Elements:**

1. **Project KanBan Board:**
   * Main reusable element where the core functionality resides.
2. **Menu Project Pop-up:**
   * Used for creating or editing projects.
   * Functionalities include displaying the pop-up, creating/editing projects, showing proper data, saving changes, resetting inputs, hiding pop-ups, and assigning projects to segments.
   * Additional functionalities like deleting projects can be accessed through the group focus project menu.

**Usage:**

* The Menu Project pop-up is designed to simplify project management across different parts of the app without the need to rebuild functionality.
* To use the pop-up in areas not directly linked to repeating groups, a hidden variant can be referenced.
* Clicking "new project" triggers the hidden variant to display the pop-up for creating or editing projects.
